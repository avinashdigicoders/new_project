            <p>
                <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b>15 October 1931 â€“ 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th <br>
                 president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. <br>
                  He spent  the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) <br>
                   and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile <br>
                    development efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and <br>
                     launch vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II <br>
                      nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.[5] <br>

                Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition <br>
                Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's President",[6] he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and <br>
              public service after a single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.</p>
